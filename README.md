# Turing Tweets

This project is designed to parse in all the tweets from a specific user and use NLP to generate a new, fake tweet. The tweet will then be displayed alongside a real tweet on a web page, and the user will be prompted to choose which one they believe is real. Once they make a selection, the correct answer and the incorrect answer are appropriately highlighted. Stretch goals include: tweeting out those tweets which succeed in stumping a user, adding some level of machine deep learning, and caching stumpers IOT tweet out only the highest success rate stumpers.
